## What is Pakz.fun

You pay USDG. You get three real ERC-20 meme tokens from a seven-asset pool. The beta fixes a future Robinhood block when the purchase is created and derives the draw from that block hash. Anyone can finalize the draw after the block exists. Every possible prize is reserved before payment and every dollar follows a published split.

**[Open the live mainnet app at pakz.fun](https://pakz.fun)**

Pack sales remain fail-closed until the simplified coordinator and replacement core are deployed, funded, audited, and proven with one real end-to-end opening. See the [mainnet status report](docs/15-mainnet-status.md).

The 4-of-7 threshold BLS system remains visible in source as an experimental upgrade under development. It is not the beta launch path. See [`contracts/src/randomness/THRESHOLD_BLS_EXPERIMENTAL.md`](contracts/src/randomness/THRESHOLD_BLS_EXPERIMENTAL.md).

## Pack tiers

| Tier | Price | You get |
|------|-------|---------|
| Trencher | 5 USDG | 3 tokens from the pool |
| Cashcat Max | 15 USDG | 3 tokens from the pool |
| Techpro | 50 USDG | 3 tokens from the pool |

Higher tier = more tokens per slot. Same seven-asset pool, same randomness.

## Economics

Every pack purchase follows one fixed split, enforced onchain:

```
80%  →  Inventory reserve   (funds the three-token payout)
10%  →  USDG jackpot vault  (1/25,000 odds, 90% of vault paid out)
10%  →  Protocol fee
```

---

## How beta randomness works

```
1. REQUEST   — the purchase fixes a future Robinhood block number
2. WAIT      — all possible prizes and payment liabilities stay reserved
3. FINALIZE  — anyone derives the random words from that fixed block hash
4. CLAIM     — the user claims three unique tokens, or refunds if the hash expires
```

The finalizer supplies no entropy and has no privileged role. This is a transparent beta mechanism, not VRF: Robinhood block producers can influence block contents and, in an extreme case, a block hash. The planned threshold BLS upgrade is retained in source but is not required for beta sales.

## Security

- Frontend verifies codehash and constructor config hash before every transaction
- Pack sales are fail-closed (`openingsPaused = true` by default)
- No operator private keys or deployer keys on Vercel
- Future-block finalization requires no privileged entropy signer
- Full Forge suite: unit, integration, fork tests

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for threat model and [AUDIT_SCOPE.md](AUDIT_SCOPE.md) for scope.
